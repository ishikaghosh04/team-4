This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that classifies psychiatric disorders using EEG-derived features. The goal is to develop a cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic tool for mental health.

Project Overview
This project utilizes Quantitative EEG (QEEG) data to classify psychiatric disorders and distinguish them from healthy controls (HCs). The features used include Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and Functional Connectivity (FC).
